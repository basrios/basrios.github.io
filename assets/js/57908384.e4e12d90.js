One could put in normal radiology reports without looking, but that is unacceptable. But how little looking is really \u2018not looking\u2019? During training, the radiologist are taught to always use an unchanging mental approach, such that they do not miss anything on any scan. In practice, radiologists still often miss, misinterpret or fail to mention findings, most of no clinical consequence, some with significant consequences.

Quality is an afterthought or a regulatory necessity. The business of radiology is ready for decentralisation, as the diagnostic radiologist can work from any location and indeed could be in any part of the world. With the right structure, a blockchain-based decentralised teleradiology system would completely disrupt the industry by eliminating adverse incentives and creating healthy competition between radiologists to provide timely, quality reads, and competition between clients to pay for these reads."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Imagine a system whereby any client, whether it be a large hospital system or small imaging center, does not need to negotiate pricing with any vendor. Instead, the client need only use open-sourced software and standards to connect to a decentralised Blockchain-based system that gives them direct access to individual radiologists, each of whom have set pricing for their reads, credentialing information, speed and quality metrics. Other software built on top of the system can automatically send studies to particular radiologists based on this public data. Reporting times, referring physician feedback and quality scores can be immutably stored on the Blockchain. Clients who need faster reads would need to pay more to compete for radiologist attention. Similarly, radiologists who are faster, have a sub specialisation or have higher quality can potentially charge more for their services. This kind of competition leads to a healthy ecosystem where incentives are aligned towards better value and optimisation along the quality, cost and timeliness dimensions.

First, most large hospital systems have draconian credentialing requirements that include submission of paper documentation of licensing and other information in order to be credentialed at a hospital to provide services. Private imaging centers are more agile in this respect and may be the first target customers. In addition, in the United States, medical licensing requirements differ from state-to-state and maintaining a 50-state license is close to impossible for a single person. These functions would also need to be decentralised and outsourced in order for the system to function. Privacy is another major issue, though solvable. For example, it is a given that each client already has their own storage. The Blockchain could simply store an encrypted access link with unique keys provided only to the radiologist to whom the case has been assigned. No patient information need actually be stored on-chain. Indeed, storing vast amounts of information on-chain is not efficient as the chain size can exponentially increase causing increased computational resource needs to run the Blockchain."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"While simple in concept, the implementation can become highly complex as anyone who has run a teleradiology company can attest.

Radiology is not only siloed with respect to the data availability and data sharing but the radiologists themselves are often cut off from the patients for whom they are reading a scan. Due to lack of actual interaction with the patient the radiologist often has to deal with vague symptom descriptions such as \u201cpain,\u201d which is often entered more for the purposes of successful billing than for actual accuracy. The quality of communication in radiology requisitions is in alarming decline (Wassermann & Straus 2018). Without an appropriate background the quality of the read suffers and ultimately results in poor patient outcomes. Often, the common advice is: why not call the ordering physician? Unfortunately, while this seems like the obvious solution the main problem is time. As already mentioned, radiologists are extremely time-limited, but so are the referring clinicians, due to the same factory mentality."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"While there have been trends towards value-based practice for healthcare in general there seems to be little movement for incorporating this for medical imaging. Programmes such as Merit Based Incentive Payments System (MIPS) have taken first steps but do not address the important issue that the radiologist is essentially blinded to the patient history and treated like a lab technician rather than a doctor. The radiologist needs to be patient-centric not image centric.

For example, quality metrics could include referring provider and patient satisfaction, compliance with MIPS criteria, structured reports, extent of report editing, number of correctly protocolled exams, appropriate follow up in concert with ACR guidelines, among others (Heller 2016).

The extent of its impact on the practice of radiology and radiology training is yet to be seen. That said, if one looks at mammography (arguably the simplest of the modalities to write and train an algorithm or AI for), it has already undergone a fundamental change due to the introduction of computer aided detection of anomalies on breast mammograms. Radiologists most often use the system as a second reader and evaluate every one of the false positives detected by such systems for the elusive true positive, but the impact on sensitivity for suspicious lesions is significant. Most likely, as AI interpretation of images becomes more and more common, the combined human and machine approach will be the wave of the future throughout radiology. Radiology will eventually morph into not only how to interpret images but how to use the various AI systems for maximum value."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The problem here is dependable data that is distributed, secure, available and constantly updated. To train the best deep learning networks, one needs as much good data as possible. Otherwise, often rare events will not be reliably detected without extensive feature engineering and the influence of selection bias will affect the generalisability of the final product. Because we often lack insight into deep learning models, biases can be insidious and become dangerous. Unlike mammograms, the number of possible pathologies increases exponentially on other modalities, increasing multi-fold the computational complexity, and therefore the needed data and training time. After initial training, the next major step is a continual improvement process where the AI constantly evolves using real-world data. This is where decentralised, trust less data sharing can have a major impact. A Blockchain-based AI can not only learn from shared data from multiple institutions, designers can track and evaluate its learning by looking back or simply replaying the chain, giving more insight and greater human oversight on AI decision making.

Finally, AI is bursting onto the scene and the need for massive amounts of good data will drive efficient, decentralised methods of data sharing and training dataset creation.
